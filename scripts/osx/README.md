mattb-setup osx scripts
=======================

A collection of OSX specific setup scripts.

Unscripted setup
----------------
Before running any of these scripts, there some other stuff I normally do on a new mac that I don't have scripted.

* Check for any updates in the Mac Store
* Manually change display scaling to “More Space”
* Manually change hostname using System Preferences -> Sharing
* Manually turn on sound icon in menu bar using System Preferences -> Sound
* Open Finder preferences and...
  * Click show for all items on the Desktop
  * Go through sidebar items and show/hide whatever you want
* Right click on Finder toolbar, add the path item and remove the ones you won't use
